<br>
  Kanban board - It helps manage projects by tracking and organizing tasks, moving them between stages to ensure progress, avoid bottlenecks, and evaluate the end-to-end process.
  <br>This Kanban board uses spoken instructions to move tasks between stages and manage workflow.

  <b>PROTOTYPE</b><br>
  The developed prototype is targeted toward computer science students and assists them in their day-to-day activities.
  <br>Some features implemented in the prototype are:
  <ul>
    <li>Updating the status of a task across the Kanban board using voice commands</li>
    <li>Updating a title of a task using voice commands</li>
    <li>Conservations with the application </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <b>Features and Command Phrases</b><br>
  Some of the major features and activating commands of the voice-based project management system expected by the system as input are listed below.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Updating a Task: <br>
    To start an update operation of a task, the following command phrases act as a trigger: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>update</li> <li>set</li> <li>change</li> <li>alter</li> <li>modify</li> <li>edit</li> <li>correct</li> <li>make</li></ul> </li>
<li>
  Updating a Status of a Task: <br>
  To update a status of a task, the update operation would have already been triggered, and updating the status would act as a follow-up event, the following phrases act as a trigger for updating a task: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>inprogress</li>
    <li>progress</li>
    <li>pending</li>
    <li>completed</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Valid Task ID: In updating a task, a task ID would be used to identify a task, and a valid task ID acts as a trigger to identify a task.<br>
    Examples to be used in this project are: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>M22</li><li>M16</li><li>M19</li>
    </ul><br>
    The system would be able to engage in dynamic conversations listening for trigger commands in a particular stage of a conversation between a user and the system and the user does not need to restart every conversation with the system. This would be done by using stages for each conversation where a particular stage would be listening for a certain set of commands to activate a function. If in any case, the system encounters an error, the system would be able to resume its initial stage from a previous conversation and carry on with the user creating a more natural conversation between the user and the system.
  </li>
</ul>
